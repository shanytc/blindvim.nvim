This plugins help you to focus on your text/code
by blanking out the rest of the text/code except your current line.
blindvim will use an array of grayscale to create a gradient effect.
Blindvim also gives a privary aspect as all the code is hidden except
the line you're on.

Usage:

                                                            *blindvim.start()*
blindvim.start()
    
    Start blindvim and hide all the text/code.


                                                             *blindvim.stop()*
blindvim.stop()

    Stop blindvim and show all the text/code.

blindvim.mark()
